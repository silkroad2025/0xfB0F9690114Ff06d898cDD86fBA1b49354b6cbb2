1. Introduction
SilkRoadCoin (SRC) is a decentralized digital asset meticulously engineered to
embody the dynamics of modern global trade routes, specifically those echoing
the historical Silk Road in their interconnectedness and economic significance.
SRC is not merely a cryptocurrency; it is the native settlement layer designed to
operate seamlessly within the broader Achaemion Web3 framework. This
framework focuses on bridging traditional economic corridors with decentralized
finance (DeFi) principles, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency in crossborder value transfer and commerce.
SRC is built on the robust and cost-effective Binance Smart Chain (BSC) using
the widely accepted BEP-20 standard, ensuring maximum compatibility with
existing DeFi infrastructure, wallets, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The
asset's core utility is tied directly to transactional enablement across
Achaemion’s suite of platforms, including marketplace settlements, residency
payment processing, and decentralized liquidity provision. Furthermore, SRC
integrates deflationary mechanics designed to foster long-term value retention
for its holders.
The concept underpinning SRC is to create a borderless, trust-minimized medium
of exchange that facilitates complex supply chain financing, virtual asset trading,
and B2B transactions that traditionally suffer from high latency and intermediary
costs in legacy financial systems.
2. Vision & Mission
Vision
To establish SilkRoadCoin (SRC) as the definitive, transparent, and decentralized
trade token that serves as the primary medium of settlement for virtual
commerce, digital services, and tokenized assets flowing across established and
emerging global economic corridors, facilitated by Achaemion technologies.
Mission
Our mission is multifaceted: 1. Utility Delivery: To embed SRC deeply within the
Achaemion Ecosystem, ensuring it possesses intrinsic utility as the preferred
medium for staking, cross-platform payments, and governance participation. 2.
Stability and Liquidity: To maintain a healthy, liquid market environment through
automated liquidity provisioning mechanisms funded by transactional taxes, thus
supporting predictable settlement values. 3. Cross-Border Facilitation: To provide
a streamlined, low-fee, and rapid mechanism for transferring value between
jurisdictions, overcoming the friction points inherent in conventional
correspondent banking networks. 4. Sustainability: To implement verifiable, onchain deflationary measures that align holder incentives with the long-term
success and reduced circulating supply of the token.

The contract implements standard BEP-20 functions, augmented with custom
logic for tax collection and automated burning mechanisms. The Owner address
retains administrative control necessary for initial deployment, critical upgrades
(if implemented via a proxy pattern, though minimized), and the execution of
scheduled burn events.
4. Tokenomics
The tokenomics model for SRC is designed around three core pillars: controlled
distribution, utilization of transactional taxes for ecosystem health, and inherent
deflation to reward long-term holding.
4.1. Initial Distribution Schedule
The initial fixed supply of 250,000,000 SRC is allocated strategically to bootstrap
development, marketing, and community growth:
80% Treasury/Owner Allocation: This substantial reserve provides the
Achaemion Ecosystem the necessary capital flexibility for long-term
development, liquidity bootstrapping, strategic acquisitions, and operational
runway. This allocation is locked or vested according to internal
compliance schedules, minimizing immediate sell pressure.
•
10% Ecosystem Development & Rewards: Reserved for staking rewards,
liquidity provider incentives, and development grants necessary to build out
the features within the Achaemion Network (SmartVerse, Zarvion Protocol).
5% Marketing & Exchange Listing: Dedicated to building global awareness,
community engagement campaigns, and securing listings on major
centralized exchanges (CEXs) to enhance accessibility and liquidity.
5% Strategic Partnerships: Allocated for vested incentives for key
integration partners, major institutional adoption efforts, and advisory
board compensation.
4.2. Transactional Taxation Structure
All non-internal transfers (buys and sells on DEXs utilizing the tax mechanism)
incur a fee, which is immediately allocated upon transaction completion.
Buy Tax (5%): The 5% collected on every purchase is directed entirely towards
Liquidity Growth.
This mechanism ensures that as trading volume increases, the base liquidity
pool (e.g., SRC/USDT) deepens, reducing slippage and enhancing market stability
for all participants.
Sell Tax (10%): The 10% fee collected on every sale is split between ecosystem
stabilization and marketing efforts, housed in the designated Tax Wallet:
Note: The precise split of the 10% sell tax is subject to future minor adjustments
based on DAO governance if active, but the initial design allocates a significant
portion to the Tax Wallet.

4.3. Deflationary Events
To counteract inflation and reward early adopters, SRC incorporates scheduled,
irreversible token destruction events executed directly via the smart contract:
Stage 1 Burn: An immediate reduction of 10% of the Initial Total Supply
upon verifiable achievement of predefined community and ecosystem
milestones (e.g., successful DEX launch and initial liquidity lock
verification).
Stage 2 Burn: A further reduction of 5% of the Initial Total Supply,
scheduled for execution upon the successful integration of SRC into the
XERION Global Residency payment system (Phase III completion).
These burns are hardcoded into the contract, ensuring transparency and
permanence of the supply reduction. The maximum total deflation from these
events alone is 15% of the initial supply, leading to a significantly lower
circulating supply over time, assuming sustained utility.
5. Functional Mechanism
The SRC smart contract on BEP-20 is engineered for high performance, security,
and specific utility implementation:
Dual-Phase Taxation: The contract logic distinguishes between buy and
sell transactions to route fees accurately. This separation is crucial for
maintaining a predictable liquidity pool (funded by the Buy Tax) while
funding operational growth (via the Sell Tax).
Deflation via Immutable Burn Functions: The contract includes privileged
functions callable only by the Owner/DAO to trigger the scheduled burns.
Once executed, the tokens are sent to an irreversible burn address
( 0x000...000 ), permanently removing them from circulation.
BEP‑20 Compliance: Full adherence to the standard ensures compatibility
with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger, and virtually all decentralized
applications (dApps) and DEXs operating on BSC. Functions like
approve , transferFrom , and balanceOf operate as expected.
Gas Efficiency: The contract codebase is optimized to minimize
computational complexity, resulting in lower gas costs for users executing

standard transfers, a key requirement for high-frequency trading and microtransactions within Achaemion platforms.
Future DAO Governance Integration: While initially centralized for
deployment and stability assurance, the structure allows for the migration
of ownership and critical parameter controls (like tax adjustments, postburn execution) to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
governed by SRC holders, ensuring decentralized control over the protocol's
future.
6. Ecosystem Integration
SilkRoadCoin derives its primary value proposition from its mandatory role within
the evolving Achaemion Network. SRC is the foundational economic pillar
connecting disparate services under the Achaemion umbrella.
6.1. Core Utility Vectors
A. Transaction Medium for SmartVerse Marketplace: SmartVerse is Achaemion’s
forthcoming decentralized marketplace for digital goods, real-world assets
(tokenized deeds, intellectual property shares), and virtual real estate. SRC will be
the primary base currency for all peer-to-peer and business-to-consumer
transactions, offering instant, low-cost settlement.
B. Settlement Token for XERION Global Residency Payments: XERION focuses on
facilitating global mobility and residency programs. SRC will serve as the
preferred, vetted token for paying administrative fees, filing costs, and
compliance charges associated with these complex international applications,
streamlining cross-jurisdictional financial interactions.
C. Cross-Asset Liquidity Token within Zarvion Protocol: Zarvion Protocol is the
DeFi arm, focusing on cross-chain asset bridging and liquidity provision. SRC will
function as a highly desirable collateral asset or a core liquidity pairing token,
providing stability and yield opportunities within Zarvion’s yield farming
strategies.
•
6.2. Active Liquidity Pools
To ensure immediate tradability and market depth post-launch, SRC is initially
provisioned across multiple critical liquidity pairs on supported DEXs (e.g.,
PancakeSwap, or specialized Zarvion DEX instances):
SRC/USDT (Stablecoin Pairing)
SRC/WBNB (Base Pairing)
SRC/MEGALAND (Internal Ecosystem Pairing)
SRC/FOX (Strategic Partner Pairing)
SRC/PIGGY (Community/Volume Pairing)
The Buy Tax feeds directly into these pairs, ensuring that trading activity directly
contributes to the depth and stability of the market.
7. Governance & Compliance
The long-term viability of SRC depends on its transition to a robust, decentralized
governance structure that aligns with evolving international regulatory
frameworks.
Migration to DAO Governance: The roadmap includes the transition to a fully
functional DAO governed by SRC holders. Initial governance mechanisms will be
deployed on the Achaemion Registry Network (ARN).
Achaemion Registry Network (ARN): The ARN is Achaemion’s dedicated layer
designed to integrate decentralized protocols with emerging global compliance
standards, particularly those analogous to the European Union's MiCA (Markets
in Crypto-Assets) regulation. This proactive stance ensures that the ecosystem
can interact legally and securely with regulated entities worldwide.
Holder Voting: Once activated, SRC holders will propose and vote on critical
protocol changes, including: * Adjustments to the Buy/Sell tax structure (within
predefined maximums). * Allocation of Tax Wallet funds for major marketing or
development initiatives. * Upgrades to the smart contract logic (via proxy
mechanisms). * Integration/de-listing of new liquidity pairs.

9. Security & Auditing
Security is paramount for a foundational asset like SRC. Our approach is layered:
Fixed Supply Minus Burns: The total potential supply is mathematically
capped (250M minus committed burns), ensuring no unexpected inflation
mechanisms are present outside of the contract code.
Transparent Ownership and Tax Flows: All critical contract addresses
(Owner, Tax Wallet) are public on BscScan. The logic governing tax
collection is auditable within the smart contract source code.
Pending Third-Party Audits: Prior to the activation of major utility phases
(Phases III and V), the SRC contract will undergo formal audits by reputable
blockchain security firms, including but not limited to GoPlus Security and
TokenSniffer, to verify the integrity of the taxation, transfer, and burn
functions. Audit reports will be made public.
MIT License Compliance: Releasing the core logic under the permissive
MIT license encourages community review and ensures transparency
regarding the open-source nature of the deployment.
